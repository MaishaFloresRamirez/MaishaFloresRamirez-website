        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Maisha Flores Ramirez and I am a first generation college student, currently attending the University of California, Riverside as a freshman. I hope to graduate in four years with a degree in Business concentrated in financing. My hobbies consist of working out, hiking, and spending time with family. While in highschool I was able to be a part of numerous organizations and clubs that have allowed me to learn more about communication and time management. I would volunteer at the Southern California Railway Museum, specifically in an event known as a Day Out with Thomas, where I would dress up as Sir Topham Hatt and take pictures with children. I needed to manage my time in the costume for thirty minutes each hour and communicate with the parents about the timing so they wouldnâ€™t waste time waiting in line. In my sophomore year I became familiar with a club known as Link Crew and applied for it in my Junior year. This organization focuses on helping freshmen transition into high school by holding social events, hosting lessons on valuable skills, and checking up on them. From this position I was able to learn how to engage with younger audiences and serve as a mentor for those who needed the help. My high school wasnâ€™t like any other because it was a military school, meaning those attending had to learn and contribute to different obligations compared to those who attended a normal school. I was particularly a part of a leadership group known at the 319th Battalion staff, where I served as an S-1. This job consisted of staying up to date with the number of students, rank promotions, and monthly events. Being an S-1 really taught me how to be organized as the job was mainly paperwork and keeping up with student data, which wasnâ€™t easy for an entire high school. Now that I am in college, I am looking forward to learning about a variety of new subjects, especially when it comes to business administration and financing.<br><br>

        One of the best things about business is the variety of concentrations offered for people of many different interests. However, I recently discovered having a preference towards working with numbers and data while taking math classes this quarter. Math has always been one of my strongest subjects, and I would like to pursue a job that could help fulfill my passion for numbers.
<br><br>

        I would love to learn more about financing and gain hands-on experience while in college. I'm really interested in any internships, work study, or entry level job opportunities available in the Riverside County area or neighboring cities. Thank you for your time and consideration!
